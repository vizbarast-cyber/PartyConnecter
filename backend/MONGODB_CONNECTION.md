## Your Complete Connection String

```
mongodb+srv://vizbarast_db_user:yRSKtzMQyMTqiueT@partyconnect.b32nyge.mongodb.net/partyconnect?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

## What Was Added

1. ✅ Password: `yRSKtzMQyMTqiueT` (removed angle brackets)
2. ✅ Database name: `partyconnect` (added after `.net/`)
3. ✅ Connection options: `?retryWrites=true&w=majority` (for reliability)

## Next Steps

1. **Update `backend/.env` file** with the complete connection string
2. **Whitelist your IP** in MongoDB Atlas (Network Access)
3. **Test the connection** by starting your backend

## Security Note

⚠️ Your password is now visible in this file. Make sure:
- `.env` is in `.gitignore` (it should be)
- Never commit `.env` to Git
- Keep your password secure
